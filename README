This is a work in progress.

The eventual goal is a genetic algorithm that can crunch many games of the collectible card game Magic the Gathering, and determine optimal decks.

Ideally, it will find novel interpretations and deck ideas that the public isn't working on.  For now, the evaluation algorithm is so simple that this is very unlikely.
